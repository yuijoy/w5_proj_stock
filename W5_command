To create a Python virtual environment in Linux, use the following commands:

1. Install Python's venv module:  sudo apt install python3-venv

2. Create a new directory for the application, and then make that directory your current working directory: mkdir my_flask_app && cd my_flask_app

3. Create the virtual environment and source the activation script:  python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Flask: pip install Flask
    install python library
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install pandas
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install scikit-learn    #sklearn
    pip install yfinance

Once the virtual environment has been created, we can go ahead and create a simple website. To get started on the Flask application, follow the ensuing steps:

1. Create a source folder: mkdir src

 This is where majority of the source code for the project will reside.

2. Create the application file: touch src/stock.py

3. Tell the system which file is the application file: export FLASK_APP=src/stock.py

4. The next step is to add code to stock.py

5. To run the Flask application, go to the terminal and execute:  flask run. The application should be accessible via this url: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
